Apple Disk Transfer (ADT) Project Moving
========================================

The BerliOS repository will be closing at the end of 2011.  Because of that, 
the ADT project has moved to GitHub here: 
[ADT Project at GitHub](https://github.com/david-schmidt/adt/wiki)
You should update your bookmarks to point to the project at GitHub as this
page on BerliOS will be going away at the end of 2011.

Apple Disk Transfer
===================

ADT is the "Apple Disk Transfer" utility. Paul Guertin originally developed
ADT as a way to transfer 5.25" disk image files from PC directly to diskette
on a 48k or larger Apple II and to send 5.25" diskettes to PC where they are
saved as .dsk disk image files. A typical ADT setup is an Apple II/IIe/IIc/IIgs
with a serial card or built-in serial port connected via a NULL modem cable to
a PC's COM port or a classic Mac's modem port with each computer running ADT.
