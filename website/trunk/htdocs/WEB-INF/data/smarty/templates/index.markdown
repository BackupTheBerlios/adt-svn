Apple Disk Transfer
===================

ADT is the "Apple Disk Transfer" utility. Paul Guertin originally developed
ADT as a way to transfer 5.25" disk image files from PC directly to diskette
on a 64k or larger Apple II and to send 5.25" diskettes to PC where they are
saved as .dsk disk image files. A typical ADT setup is an Apple II/IIe/IIc/IIgs
with a serial card or built-in serial port connected via a NULL modem cable to
a PC's COM port with each computer running ADT.

News
====

**27 Dec 2006**: ADT 2006 is released.  Some goodies from the 
[ADTPro project](http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/) have been incorporated
into ADT.  See the
[download](http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5617)
page for details and downloads.

**31 Dec 2005**: ADT now has a new home at
[BerliOS](http://developer.berlios.de/). BerliOS provides web hosting, a
download service, and a Subversion source code repository. See the [project
page](http://developer.berlios.de/projects/adt/) for all the goodies.

Setting Up and Using ADT
========================

Download [ADT\_2006.zip](http://download.berlios.de/adt/ADT_2006.zip) and
unzip the archive. The result is a folder named "ADT\_2006". This includes
a Windows and MS-DOS program, as well as the three most popular Apple II-side
programs.

PC Side
-------

* `adt.exe`: A Windows32 version of the PC-side program by Sean Gugler.

* `adtdos.exe`: An MS-DOS version of the PC-side program by Paul Guertin.

Apple II Side
-------------

* `ADT`: This is the original ADT (now at version 1.31). It is intended for
  use on an Apple II equipped with Apple's Super Serial Card (SSC) or a
  compatible card, or the Apple IIgs.
  
* `ADTcc`: This is an adaptation of ADT (now at version 1.21) intended 
  for use on an Apple II equipped with the Apple Communications Card 
  and other, generally older, non-SSC cards.
  
You will need to transfer one of the Apple II-side ADT programs to the Apple
II. How to do the transfer, setting up a NULL modem connection, and more is
discussed in the included Text documentation files. Also see the
[comp.sys.apple2](news:comp.sys.apple2) Apple II FAQs
[Telecom-1](http://home.swbell.net/rubywand/Csa2T1TCOM.html) page and feel
free to ask questions on the newsgroup.  The ADTPro project has a 
[bootstrapping page](http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/bootstrap.html) that may
be helpful as well.

The ADT\_2006 distribution allows running ADT under Windows or from the MS-DOS
prompt. To start the Win32 version, double-click `adt.exe` or run it from a
Command Prompt.
